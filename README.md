# hydraulic_breakages_classfication
The dataset was obtained through a hydraulic test rig,the system has 17 sensors which can keep track records over every cycle.In the project,our job was to extract valuable information from the data, and build predictive machine learning models to help us to predict specific target variable -Internal pump leakage.Objective of this project is to achieve a better prediction accuracy for internal pump leak,by doing so we are able to better gauge when to replace the pump.In the long run it will also help us save money since we're replacing the pumps just before the leak is predicted to occur.
